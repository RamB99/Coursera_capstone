#Segmentation of Neighborhoods in Toronto
Major tools and python libraries include: pandas, numpy, folium, matplotlib, sklearn cluster, and Rest Api. 
In "Segmentation of Neighborhoods in Toronto", I created a pandas dataframe using wikipedia data on Toronto Neighborhoods. From this, I gauge more information about the neighborhoods in Toronto by calling an API from Foursquare to explore nearby venues, and applying a simple k-means clustering algorithm in order to segment those neighborhoods.
This allowed me to learn about: utilizing location data and applying machine learning methods in a real life situation, analyzing results after segmentation, and gauging useful data from API calls.
